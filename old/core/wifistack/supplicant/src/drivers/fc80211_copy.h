/**
 * DOC: Station handling
 *
 * Stations are added per interface, but a special case exists with VLAN
 * interfaces. When a station is bound to an AP interface, it may be moved
 * into a VLAN identified by a VLAN interface index (%FC80211_ATTR_STA_VLAN).
 * The station is still assumed to belong to the AP interface it was added
 * to.
 *
 * Station handling varies per interface type and depending on the driver's
 * capabilities.
 *
 * For drivers supporting TDLS with external setup (SOFTMAC_FLAG_SUPPORTS_TDLS
 * and SOFTMAC_FLAG_TDLS_EXTERNAL_SETUP), the station lifetime is as follows:
 *  - a setup station entry is added, not yet authorized, without any rate
 *    or capability information, this just exists to avoid race conditions
 *  - when the TDLS setup is done, a single FC80211_CMD_SET_STATION is valid
 *    to add rate and capability information to the station and at the same
 *    time mark it authorized.
 *  - %FC80211_TDLS_ENABLE_LINK is then used
 *  - after this, the only valid operation is to remove it by tearing down
 *    the TDLS link (%FC80211_TDLS_DISABLE_LINK)
 *
 * TODO: need more info for other interface types

/**
 * DOC: Frame transmission/registration support
 *
 * Frame transmission and registration support exists to allow userspace
 * management entities such as wpa_supplicant react to management frames
 * that are not being handled by the kernel. This includes, for example,
 * certain classes of action frames that cannot be handled in the kernel
 * for various reasons.
 *
 * Frame registration is done on a per-interface basis and registrations
 * cannot be removed other than by closing the socket. It is possible to
 * specify a registration filter to register, for example, only for a
 * certain type of action frame. In particular with action frames, those
 * that userspace registers for will not be returned as unhandled by the
 * driver, so that the registered application has to take responsibility
 * for doing that.
 *
 * The type of frame that can be registered for is also dependent on the
 * driver and interface type. The frame types are advertised in softmac
 * attributes so applications know what to expect.
 *
 * NOTE: When an interface changes type while registrations are active,
 *       these registrations are ignored until the interface type is
 *       changed again. This means that changing the interface type can
 *       lead to a situation that couldn't otherwise be produced, but
 *       any such registrations will be dormant in the sense that they
 *       will not be serviced, i.e. they will not receive any frames.
 *
 * Frame transmission allows userspace to send for example the required
 * responses to action frames. It is subject to some sanity checking,
 * but many frames can be transmitted. When a frame was transmitted, its
 * status is indicated to the sending socket.
 *
 * For more technical details, see the corresponding command descriptions
 * below.

/**
 * DOC: Virtual interface / concurrency capabilities
 *
 * Some devices are able to operate with virtual MACs, they can have
 * more than one virtual interface. The capability handling for this
 * is a bit complex though, as there may be a number of restrictions
 * on the types of concurrency that are supported.
 *
 * To start with, each device supports the interface types listed in
 * the %FC80211_ATTR_SUPPORTED_IFTYPES attribute, but by listing the
 * types there no concurrency is implied.
 *
 * Once concurrency is desired, more attributes must be observed:
 * To start with, since some interface types are purely managed in
 * software, like the AP-VLAN type in macd11 for example, there's
 * an additional list of these, they can be added at any time and
 * are only restricted by some semantic restrictions (e.g. AP-VLAN
 * cannot be added without a corresponding AP interface). This list
 * is exported in the %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTWARE_IFTYPES attribute.
 *
 * Further, the list of supported combinations is exported. This is
 * in the %FC80211_ATTR_INTERFACE_COMBINATIONS attribute. Basically,
 * it exports a list of "groups", and at any point in time the
 * interfaces that are currently active must fall into any one of
 * the advertised groups. Within each group, there are restrictions
 * on the number of interfaces of different types that are supported
 * and also the number of different channels, along with potentially
 * some other restrictions. See &enum fc80211_if_combination_attrs.
 *
 * All together, these attributes define the concurrency of virtual
 * interfaces that a given device supports.

/**
 * DOC: packet coalesce support
 *
 * In most cases, host that receives IPv4 and IPv6 multicast/broadcast
 * packets does not do anything with these packets. Therefore the
 * reception of these unwanted packets causes unnecessary processing
 * and power consumption.
 *
 * Packet coalesce feature helps to reduce number of received interrupts
 * to host by buffering these packets in firmware/hardware for some
 * predefined time. Received interrupt will be generated when one of the
 * following events occur.
 * a) Expiration of hardware timer whose expiration time is set to maximum
 * coalescing delay of matching coalesce rule.
 * b) Coalescing buffer in hardware reaches it's limit.
 * c) Packet doesn't match any of the configured coalesce rules.
 *
 * User needs to configure following parameters for creating a coalesce
 * rule.
 * a) Maximum coalescing delay
 * b) List of packet patterns which needs to be matched
 * c) Condition for coalescence. pattern 'match' or 'no match'
 * Multiple such rules can be created.

 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_REG: ask the wireless core to send us its currently set
 * 	regulatory domain.
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_REG: Set current regulatory domain. CRDA sends this command
 *	after being queried by the kernel. CRDA replies by sending a regulatory
 *	domain structure which consists of %FC80211_ATTR_REG_ALPHA set to our
 *	current alpha2 if it found a match. It also provides
 * 	FC80211_ATTR_REG_RULE_FLAGS, and a set of regulatory rules. Each
 * 	regulatory rule is a nested set of attributes  given by

 * 	%FC80211_ATTR_FREQ_RANGE_MAX_BW with an attached power rule given by
 * 	%FC80211_ATTR_REG_RULE_POWER_MAX_ANT_GAIN and
 * 	%FC80211_ATTR_REG_RULE_POWER_MAX_EIRP.
 * @FC80211_CMD_REQ_SET_REG: ask the wireless core to set the regulatory domain
 * 	to the specified ISO/IEC 3166-1 alpha2 country code. The core will
 * 	store this as a valid request and then query userspace for it.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_MESH_CONFIG: Get mesh networking properties for the
 *	interface identified by %FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_MESH_CONFIG: Set mesh networking properties for the
 *      interface identified by %FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_MGMT_EXTRA_IE: Set extra IEs for management frames. The
 *	interface is identified with %FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX and the management
 *	frame subtype with %FC80211_ATTR_MGMT_SUBTYPE. The extra IE data to be
 *	added to the end of the specified management frame is specified with
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_IE. If the command succeeds, the requested data will be
 *	added to all specified management frames generated by
 *	kernel/firmware/driver.
 *	Note: This command has been removed and it is only reserved at this
 *	point to avoid re-using existing command number. The functionality this
 *	command was planned for has been provided with cleaner design with the
 *	option to specify additional IEs in FC80211_CMD_TRIGGER_SCAN,
 *	FC80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE, FC80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE,
 *	FC80211_CMD_DEAUTHENTICATE, and FC80211_CMD_DISASSOCIATE.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_SCAN: get scan results
 * @FC80211_CMD_TRIGGER_SCAN: trigger a new scan with the given parameters
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_TX_NO_CCK_RATE is used to decide whether to send the
 *	probe requests at CCK rate or not.
 * @FC80211_CMD_NEW_SCAN_RESULTS: scan notification (as a reply to
 *	FC80211_CMD_GET_SCAN and on the "scan" multicast group)
 * @FC80211_CMD_SCAN_ABORTED: scan was aborted, for unspecified reasons,
 *	partial scan results may be available
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_START_SCHED_SCAN: start a scheduled scan at certain
 *	intervals, as specified by %FC80211_ATTR_SCHED_SCAN_INTERVAL.
 *	Like with normal scans, if SSIDs (%FC80211_ATTR_SCAN_SSIDS)
 *	are passed, they are used in the probe requests.  For
 *	broadcast, a broadcast SSID must be passed (ie. an empty
 *	string).  If no SSID is passed, no probe requests are sent and
 *	a passive scan is performed.  %FC80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES,
 *	if passed, define which channels should be scanned; if not
 *	passed, all channels allowed for the current regulatory domain
 *	are used.  Extra IEs can also be passed from the userspace by
 *	using the %FC80211_ATTR_IE attribute.
 * @FC80211_CMD_STOP_SCHED_SCAN: stop a scheduled scan. Returns -ENOENT if
 *	scheduled scan is not running. The caller may assume that as soon
 *	as the call returns, it is safe to start a new scheduled scan again.
 * @FC80211_CMD_SCHED_SCAN_RESULTS: indicates that there are scheduled scan
 *	results available.
 * @FC80211_CMD_SCHED_SCAN_STOPPED: indicates that the scheduled scan has
 *	stopped.  The driver may issue this event at any time during a
 *	scheduled scan.  One reason for stopping the scan is if the hardware
 *	does not support starting an association or a normal scan while running
 *	a scheduled scan.  This event is also sent when the
 *	%FC80211_CMD_STOP_SCHED_SCAN command is received or when the interface
 *	is brought down while a scheduled scan was running.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_SURVEY: get survey resuls, e.g. channel occupation
 *      or noise level
 * @FC80211_CMD_NEW_SURVEY_RESULTS: survey data notification (as a reply to
 *	FC80211_CMD_GET_SURVEY and on the "scan" multicast group)
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_PMKSA: Add a PMKSA cache entry, using %FC80211_ATTR_MAC
 *	(for the BSSID) and %FC80211_ATTR_PMKID.
 * @FC80211_CMD_DEL_PMKSA: Delete a PMKSA cache entry, using %FC80211_ATTR_MAC
 *	(for the BSSID) and %FC80211_ATTR_PMKID.
 * @FC80211_CMD_FLUSH_PMKSA: Flush all PMKSA cache entries.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_REG_CHANGE: indicates to userspace the regulatory domain
 * 	has been changed and provides details of the request information
 * 	that caused the change such as who initiated the regulatory request
 * 	(%FC80211_ATTR_REG_INITIATOR), the softmac_idx
 * 	(%FC80211_ATTR_REG_ALPHA2) on which the request was made from if
 * 	the initiator was %FC80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_COUNTRY_IE or
 * 	%FC80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER, the type of regulatory domain
 * 	set (%FC80211_ATTR_REG_TYPE), if the type of regulatory domain is
 * 	%FC80211_REG_TYPE_COUNTRY the alpha2 to which we have moved on
 * 	to (%FC80211_ATTR_REG_ALPHA2).
 * @FC80211_CMD_REG_BEACON_HINT: indicates to userspace that an AP beacon
 * 	has been found while world roaming thus enabling active scan or
 * 	any mode of operation that initiates TX (beacons) on a channel
 * 	where we would not have been able to do either before. As an example
 * 	if you are world roaming (regulatory domain set to world or if your
 * 	driver is using a custom world roaming regulatory domain) and while
 * 	doing a passive scan on the 5 GHz band you find an AP there (if not
 * 	on a DFS channel) you will now be able to actively scan for that AP
 * 	or use AP mode on your card on that same channel. Note that this will
 * 	never be used for channels 1-11 on the 2 GHz band as they are always
 * 	enabled world wide. This beacon hint is only sent if your device had
 * 	either disabled active scanning or beaconing on a channel. We send to
 * 	userspace the softmac on which we removed a restriction from
 * 	(%FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC) and the channel on which this occurred
 * 	before (%FC80211_ATTR_FREQ_BEFORE) and after (%FC80211_ATTR_FREQ_AFTER)
 * 	the beacon hint was processed.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE: authentication request and notification.
 *	This command is used both as a command (request to authenticate) and
 *	as an event on the "mlme" multicast group indicating completion of the
 *	authentication process.
 *	When used as a command, %FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to identify the
 *	interface. %FC80211_ATTR_MAC is used to specify PeerSTAAddress (and
 *	BSSID in case of station mode). %FC80211_ATTR_SSID is used to specify
 *	the SSID (mainly for association, but is included in authentication
 *	request, too, to help BSS selection. %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ is used
 *	to specify the frequence of the channel in MHz. %FC80211_ATTR_AUTH_TYPE
 *	is used to specify the authentication type. %FC80211_ATTR_IE is used to
 *	define IEs (VendorSpecificInfo, but also including RSN IE and FT IEs)
 *	to be added to the frame.
 *	When used as an event, this reports reception of an Authentication
 *	frame in station and IBSS modes when the local MLME processed the
 *	frame, i.e., it was for the local STA and was received in correct
 *	state. This is similar to MLME-AUTHENTICATE.confirm primitive in the
 *	MLME SAP interface (kernel providing MLME, userspace SME). The
 *	included %FC80211_ATTR_FRAME attribute contains the management frame
 *	(including both the header and frame body, but not FCS). This event is
 *	also used to indicate if the authentication attempt timed out. In that
 *	case the %FC80211_ATTR_FRAME attribute is replaced with a
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_TIMED_OUT flag (and %FC80211_ATTR_MAC to indicate which
 *	pending authentication timed out).
 * @FC80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE: association request and notification; like
 *	FC80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE but for Association and Reassociation
 *	(similar to MLME-ASSOCIATE.request, MLME-REASSOCIATE.request,
 *	MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm or MLME-REASSOCIATE.confirm primitives).
 * @FC80211_CMD_DEAUTHENTICATE: deauthentication request and notification; like
 *	FC80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE but for Deauthentication frames (similar to
 *	MLME-DEAUTHENTICATION.request and MLME-DEAUTHENTICATE.indication
 *	primitives).
 * @FC80211_CMD_DISASSOCIATE: disassociation request and notification; like
 *	FC80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE but for Disassociation frames (similar to
 *	MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request and MLME-DISASSOCIATE.indication primitives).
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_MICHAEL_MIC_FAILURE: notification of a locally detected Michael
 *	MIC (part of TKIP) failure; sent on the "mlme" multicast group; the
 *	event includes %FC80211_ATTR_MAC to describe the source MAC address of
 *	the frame with invalid MIC, %FC80211_ATTR_KEY_TYPE to show the key
 *	type, %FC80211_ATTR_KEY_IDX to indicate the key identifier, and
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_KEY_SEQ to indicate the TSC value of the frame; this
 *	event matches with MLME-MICHAELMICFAILURE.indication() primitive
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_JOIN_IBSS: Join a new IBSS -- given at least an SSID and a
 *	FREQ attribute (for the initial frequency if no peer can be found)
 *	and optionally a MAC (as BSSID) and FREQ_FIXED attribute if those
 *	should be fixed rather than automatically determined. Can only be
 *	executed on a network interface that is UP, and fixed BSSID/FREQ
 *	may be rejected. Another optional parameter is the beacon interval,
 *	given in the %FC80211_ATTR_BEACON_INTERVAL attribute, which if not
 *	given defaults to 100 TU (102.4ms).
 * @FC80211_CMD_LEAVE_IBSS: Leave the IBSS -- no special arguments, the IBSS is
 *	determined by the network interface.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_TESTMODE: testmode command, takes a softmac (or ifindex) attribute
 *	to identify the device, and the TESTDATA blob attribute to pass through
 *	to the driver.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_CONNECT: connection request and notification; this command
 *	requests to connect to a specified network but without separating
 *	auth and assoc steps. For this, you need to specify the SSID in a
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_SSID attribute, and can optionally specify the association
 *	IEs in %FC80211_ATTR_IE, %FC80211_ATTR_AUTH_TYPE, %FC80211_ATTR_USE_MFP,
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_MAC, %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ, %FC80211_ATTR_CONTROL_PORT,
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_CONTROL_PORT_ETHERTYPE,
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_CONTROL_PORT_NO_ENCRYPT, %FC80211_ATTR_MAC_HINT, and
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ_HINT.
 *	If included, %FC80211_ATTR_MAC and %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ are
 *	restrictions on BSS selection, i.e., they effectively prevent roaming
 *	within the ESS. %FC80211_ATTR_MAC_HINT and %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ_HINT
 *	can be included to provide a recommendation of the initial BSS while
 *	allowing the driver to roam to other BSSes within the ESS and also to
 *	ignore this recommendation if the indicated BSS is not ideal. Only one
 *	set of BSSID,frequency parameters is used (i.e., either the enforcing
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_MAC,%FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ or the less strict
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_MAC_HINT and %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ_HINT).
 *	Background scan period can optionally be
 *	specified in %FC80211_ATTR_BG_SCAN_PERIOD,
 *	if not specified default background scan configuration
 *	in driver is used and if period value is 0, bg scan will be disabled.
 *	This attribute is ignored if driver does not support roam scan.
 *	It is also sent as an event, with the BSSID and response IEs when the
 *	connection is established or failed to be established. This can be
 *	determined by the STATUS_CODE attribute.
 * @FC80211_CMD_ROAM: request that the card roam (currently not implemented),
 *	sent as an event when the card/driver roamed by itself.
 * @FC80211_CMD_DISCONNECT: drop a given connection; also used to notify
 *	userspace that a connection was dropped by the AP or due to other
 *	reasons, for this the %FC80211_ATTR_DISCONNECTED_BY_AP and
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_REASON_CODE attributes are used.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_SOFTMAC_NETNS: Set a softmac's netns. Note that all devices
 *	associated with this softmac must be down and will follow.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL: Request to remain awake on the specified
 *	channel for the specified amount of time. This can be used to do
 *	off-channel operations like transmit a Public Action frame and wait for
 *	a response while being associated to an AP on another channel.
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to specify which interface (and thus
 *	radio) is used. %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ is used to specify the
 *	frequency for the operation.
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_DURATION is used to specify the duration in milliseconds
 *	to remain on the channel. This command is also used as an event to
 *	notify when the requested duration starts (it may take a while for the
 *	driver to schedule this time due to other concurrent needs for the
 *	radio).
 *	When called, this operation returns a cookie (%FC80211_ATTR_COOKIE)
 *	that will be included with any events pertaining to this request;
 *	the cookie is also used to cancel the request.
 * @FC80211_CMD_CANCEL_REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL: This command can be used to cancel a
 *	pending remain-on-channel duration if the desired operation has been
 *	completed prior to expiration of the originally requested duration.
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC or %FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to specify the
 *	radio. The %FC80211_ATTR_COOKIE attribute must be given as well to
 *	uniquely identify the request.
 *	This command is also used as an event to notify when a requested
 *	remain-on-channel duration has expired.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_TX_BITRATE_MASK: Set the mask of rates to be used in TX
 *	rate selection. %FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to specify the interface
 *	and @FC80211_ATTR_TX_RATES the set of allowed rates.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_REGISTER_FRAME: Register for receiving certain mgmt frames
 *	(via @FC80211_CMD_FRAME) for processing in userspace. This command
 *	requires an interface index, a frame type attribute (optional for
 *	backward compatibility reasons, if not given assumes action frames)
 *	and a match attribute containing the first few bytes of the frame
 *	that should match, e.g. a single byte for only a category match or
 *	four bytes for vendor frames including the OUI. The registration
 *	cannot be dropped, but is removed automatically when the netlink
 *	socket is closed. Multiple registrations can be made.
 * @FC80211_CMD_REGISTER_ACTION: Alias for @FC80211_CMD_REGISTER_FRAME for
 *	backward compatibility
 * @FC80211_CMD_FRAME: Management frame TX request and RX notification. This
 *	command is used both as a request to transmit a management frame and
 *	as an event indicating reception of a frame that was not processed in
 *	kernel code, but is for us (i.e., which may need to be processed in a
 *	user space application). %FC80211_ATTR_FRAME is used to specify the
 *	frame contents (including header). %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ is used
 *	to indicate on which channel the frame is to be transmitted or was
 *	received. If this channel is not the current channel (remain-on-channel
 *	or the operational channel) the device will switch to the given channel
 *	and transmit the frame, optionally waiting for a response for the time
 *	specified using %FC80211_ATTR_DURATION. When called, this operation
 *	returns a cookie (%FC80211_ATTR_COOKIE) that will be included with the
 *	TX status event pertaining to the TX request.
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_TX_NO_CCK_RATE is used to decide whether to send the
 *	management frames at CCK rate or not in 2GHz band.
 * @FC80211_CMD_FRAME_WAIT_CANCEL: When an off-channel TX was requested, this
 *	command may be used with the corresponding cookie to cancel the wait
 *	time if it is known that it is no longer necessary.
 * @FC80211_CMD_ACTION: Alias for @FC80211_CMD_FRAME for backward compatibility.
 * @FC80211_CMD_FRAME_TX_STATUS: Report TX status of a management frame
 *	transmitted with %FC80211_CMD_FRAME. %FC80211_ATTR_COOKIE identifies
 *	the TX command and %FC80211_ATTR_FRAME includes the contents of the
 *	frame. %FC80211_ATTR_ACK flag is included if the recipient acknowledged
 *	the frame.
 * @FC80211_CMD_ACTION_TX_STATUS: Alias for @FC80211_CMD_FRAME_TX_STATUS for
 *	backward compatibility.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_POWER_SAVE: Set powersave, using %FC80211_ATTR_PS_STATE
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_POWER_SAVE: Get powersave status in %FC80211_ATTR_PS_STATE
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_CQM: Connection quality monitor configuration. This command
 *	is used to configure connection quality monitoring notification trigger
 *	levels.
 * @FC80211_CMD_NOTIFY_CQM: Connection quality monitor notification. This
 *	command is used as an event to indicate the that a trigger level was
 *	reached.
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_CHANNEL: Set the channel (using %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ
 *	and the attributes determining channel width) the given interface
 *	(identifed by %FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX) shall operate on.
 *	In case multiple channels are supported by the device, the mechanism
 *	with which it switches channels is implementation-defined.
 *	When a monitor interface is given, it can only switch channel while
 *	no other interfaces are operating to avoid disturbing the operation
 *	of any other interfaces, and other interfaces will again take
 *	precedence when they are used.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_WDS_PEER: Set the MAC address of the peer on a WDS interface.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_JOIN_MESH: Join a mesh. The mesh ID must be given, and initial
 *	mesh config parameters may be given.
 * @FC80211_CMD_LEAVE_MESH: Leave the mesh network -- no special arguments, the
 *	network is determined by the network interface.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_UNPROT_DEAUTHENTICATE: Unprotected deauthentication frame
 *	notification. This event is used to indicate that an unprotected
 *	deauthentication frame was dropped when MFP is in use.
 * @FC80211_CMD_UNPROT_DISASSOCIATE: Unprotected disassociation frame
 *	notification. This event is used to indicate that an unprotected
 *	disassociation frame was dropped when MFP is in use.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_NEW_PEER_CANDIDATE: Notification on the reception of a
 *      beacon or probe response from a compatible mesh peer.  This is only
 *      sent while no station information (sta_info) exists for the new peer
 *      candidate and when @FC80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_AUTH,
 *      @FC80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_AMPE, or
 *      @FC80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_MPM is set.  On reception of this
 *      notification, userspace may decide to create a new station
 *      (@FC80211_CMD_NEW_STATION).  To stop this notification from
 *      reoccurring, the userspace authentication daemon may want to create the
 *      new station with the AUTHENTICATED flag unset and maybe change it later
 *      depending on the authentication result.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_WOWLAN: get Wake-on-Wireless-LAN (WoWLAN) settings.
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_WOWLAN: set Wake-on-Wireless-LAN (WoWLAN) settings.
 *	Since wireless is more complex than wired ethernet, it supports
 *	various triggers. These triggers can be configured through this
 *	command with the %FC80211_ATTR_WOWLAN_TRIGGERS attribute. For
 *	more background information, see
 *	http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/WoWLAN.
 *	The @FC80211_CMD_SET_WOWLAN command can also be used as a notification
 *	from the driver reporting the wakeup reason. In this case, the
 *	@FC80211_ATTR_WOWLAN_TRIGGERS attribute will contain the reason
 *	for the wakeup, if it was caused by wireless. If it is not present
 *	in the wakeup notification, the wireless device didn't cause the
 *	wakeup but reports that it was woken up.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_REKEY_OFFLOAD: This command is used give the driver
 *	the necessary information for supporting GTK rekey offload. This
 *	feature is typically used during WoWLAN. The configuration data
 *	is contained in %FC80211_ATTR_REKEY_DATA (which is nested and
 *	contains the data in sub-attributes). After rekeying happened,
 *	this command may also be sent by the driver as an MLME event to
 *	inform userspace of the new replay counter.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_PMKSA_CANDIDATE: This is used as an event to inform userspace
 *	of PMKSA caching dandidates.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_TDLS_OPER: Perform a high-level TDLS command (e.g. link setup).
 *	In addition, this can be used as an event to request userspace to take
 *	actions on TDLS links (set up a new link or tear down an existing one).
 *	In such events, %FC80211_ATTR_TDLS_OPERATION indicates the requested
 *	operation, %FC80211_ATTR_MAC contains the peer MAC address, and
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_REASON_CODE the reason code to be used (only with
 *	%FC80211_TDLS_TEARDOWN).
 * @FC80211_CMD_TDLS_MGMT: Send a TDLS management frame. The
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_TDLS_ACTION attribute determines the type of frame to be
 *	sent. Public Action codes (802.11-2012 8.1.5.1) will be sent as
 *	802.11 management frames, while TDLS action codes (802.11-2012
 *	8.5.13.1) will be encapsulated and sent as data frames. The currently
 *	supported Public Action code is %WLAN_PUB_ACTION_TDLS_DISCOVER_RES
 *	and the currently supported TDLS actions codes are given in
 *	&enum i3ed11_tdls_actioncode.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_FRAME: Used by an application controlling an AP
 *	(or GO) interface (i.e. hostapd) to ask for unexpected frames to
 *	implement sending deauth to stations that send unexpected class 3
 *	frames. Also used as the event sent by the kernel when such a frame
 *	is received.
 *	For the event, the %FC80211_ATTR_MAC attribute carries the TA and
 *	other attributes like the interface index are present.
 *	If used as the command it must have an interface index and you can
 *	only unsubscribe from the event by closing the socket. Subscription
 *	is also for %FC80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_4ADDR_FRAME events.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_4ADDR_FRAME: Sent as an event indicating that the
 *	associated station identified by %FC80211_ATTR_MAC sent a 4addr frame
 *	and wasn't already in a 4-addr VLAN. The event will be sent similarly
 *	to the %FC80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_FRAME event, to the same listener.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_PROBE_CLIENT: Probe an associated station on an AP interface
 *	by sending a null data frame to it and reporting when the frame is
 *	acknowleged. This is used to allow timing out inactive clients. Uses
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX and %FC80211_ATTR_MAC. The command returns a
 *	direct reply with an %FC80211_ATTR_COOKIE that is later used to match
 *	up the event with the request. The event includes the same data and
 *	has %FC80211_ATTR_ACK set if the frame was ACKed.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_REGISTER_BEACONS: Register this socket to receive beacons from
 *	other BSSes when any interfaces are in AP mode. This helps implement
 *	OLBC handling in hostapd. Beacons are reported in %FC80211_CMD_FRAME
 *	messages. Note that per PHY only one application may register.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_NOACK_MAP: sets a bitmap for the individual TIDs whether
 *      No Acknowledgement Policy should be applied.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_CH_SWITCH_NOTIFY: An AP or GO may decide to switch channels
 *	independently of the userspace SME, send this event indicating
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is now on %FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ and the
 *	attributes determining channel width.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_START_P2P_DEVICE: Start the given P2P Device, identified by
 *	its %FC80211_ATTR_WDEV identifier. It must have been created with
 *	%FC80211_CMD_NEW_INTERFACE previously. After it has been started, the
 *	P2P Device can be used for P2P operations, e.g. remain-on-channel and
 *	public action frame TX.
 * @FC80211_CMD_STOP_P2P_DEVICE: Stop the given P2P Device, identified by
 *	its %FC80211_ATTR_WDEV identifier.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_CONN_FAILED: connection request to an AP failed; used to
 *	notify userspace that AP has rejected the connection request from a
 *	station, due to particular reason. %FC80211_ATTR_CONN_FAILED_REASON
 *	is used for this.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_MCAST_RATE: Change the rate used to send multicast frames
 *	for IBSS or MESH vif.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_MAC_ACL: sets ACL for MAC address based access control.
 *	This is to be used with the drivers advertising the support of MAC
 *	address based access control. List of MAC addresses is passed in
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_MAC_ADDRS and ACL policy is passed in
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_ACL_POLICY. Driver will enable ACL with this list, if it
 *	is not already done. The new list will replace any existing list. Driver
 *	will clear its ACL when the list of MAC addresses passed is empty. This
 *	command is used in AP/P2P GO mode. Driver has to make sure to clear its
 *	ACL list during %FC80211_CMD_STOP_AP.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_RADAR_DETECT: Start a Channel availability check (CAC). Once
 *	a radar is detected or the channel availability scan (CAC) has finished
 *	or was aborted, or a radar was detected, usermode will be notified with
 *	this event. This command is also used to notify userspace about radars
 *	while operating on this channel.
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_RADAR_EVENT is used to inform about the type of the
 *	event.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES: Get global fc80211 protocol features,
 *	i.e. features for the fc80211 protocol rather than device features.
 *	Returns the features in the %FC80211_ATTR_PROTOCOL_FEATURES bitmap.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_UPDATE_FT_IES: Pass down the most up-to-date Fast Transition
 *	Information Element to the WLAN driver
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_FT_EVENT: Send a Fast transition event from the WLAN driver
 *	to the supplicant. This will carry the target AP's MAC address along
 *	with the relevant Information Elements. This event is used to report
 *	received FT IEs (MDIE, FTIE, RSN IE, TIE, RICIE).
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_CRIT_PROTOCOL_START: Indicates user-space will start running
 *	a critical protocol that needs more reliability in the connection to
 *	complete.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_CRIT_PROTOCOL_STOP: Indicates the connection reliability can
 *	return back to normal.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_GET_COALESCE: Get currently supported coalesce rules.
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_COALESCE: Configure coalesce rules or clear existing rules.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_CHANNEL_SWITCH: Perform a channel switch by announcing the
 *	the new channel information (Channel Switch Announcement - CSA)
 *	in the beacon for some time (as defined in the
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_CH_SWITCH_COUNT parameter) and then change to the
 *	new channel. Userspace provides the new channel information (using
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_SOFTMAC_FREQ and the attributes determining channel
 *	width). %FC80211_ATTR_CH_SWITCH_BLOCK_TX may be supplied to inform
 *	other station that transmission must be blocked until the channel
 *	switch is complete.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_VENDOR: Vendor-specified command/event. The command is specified
 *	by the %FC80211_ATTR_VENDOR_ID attribute and a sub-command in
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_VENDOR_SUBCMD. Parameter(s) can be transported in
 *	%FC80211_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA.
 *	For feature advertisement, the %FC80211_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA attribute is
 *	used in the softmac data as a nested attribute containing descriptions
 *	(&struct fc80211_vendor_cmd_info) of the supported vendor commands.
 *	This may also be sent as an event with the same attributes.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_SET_QOS_MAP: Set Interworking QoS mapping for IP DSCP values.
 *	The QoS mapping information is included in %FC80211_ATTR_QOS_MAP. If
 *	that attribute is not included, QoS mapping is disabled. Since this
 *	QoS mapping is relevant for IP packets, it is only valid during an
 *	association. This is cleared on disassociation and AP restart.
 *
 * @FC80211_CMD_MAX: highest used command number
 * @__FC80211_CMD_AFTER_LAST: internal use

 *	cycles, in msecs.
 *
 * @FC80211_ATTR_SCHED_SCAN_MATCH: Nested attribute with one or more
 *	sets of attributes to match during scheduled scans.  Only BSSs
 *	that match any of the sets will be reported.  These are
 *	pass-thru filter rules.
 *	For a match to succeed, the BSS must match all attributes of a
 *	set.  Since not every hardware supports matching all types of
 *	attributes, there is no guarantee that the reported BSSs are
 *	fully complying with the match sets and userspace needs to be
 *	able to ignore them by itself.
 *	Thus, the implementation is somewhat hardware-dependent, but
 *	this is only an optimization and the userspace application
 *	needs to handle all the non-filtered results anyway.
 *	If the match attributes don't make sense when combined with
 *	the values passed in @FC80211_ATTR_SCAN_SSIDS (eg. if an SSID
 *	is included in the probe request, but the match attributes
 *	will never let it go through), -EINVAL may be returned.
 *	If ommited, no filtering is done.

 *	driver (or firmware) replies to Probe Request frames.
 * @FC80211_ATTR_IE_ASSOC_RESP: Information element(s) for (Re)Association
 *	Response frames. This is used with %FC80211_CMD_NEW_BEACON and

 *
 * @FC80211_ATTR_TX_NO_CCK_RATE: Indicates whether to use CCK rate or not
 *	for management frames transmission. In order to avoid p2p probe/action
 *	frames are being transmitted at CCK rate in 2GHz band, the user space
 *	applications use this attribute.

 *	the driver to not wait for an acknowledgement. Note that due to this,
 *	it will also not give a status callback nor return a cookie. This is
 *	mostly useful for probe responses to save airtime.

 *      the station debugfs ht_caps file.
 *
 * @FC80211_ATTR_DFS_REGION: region for regulatory rules which this country
 *    abides to when initiating radiation on DFS channels. A country maps

/**
 * DOC: TCP connection wakeup
 *
 * Some devices can establish a TCP connection in order to be woken up by a
 * packet coming in from outside their network segment, or behind NAT. If
 * configured, the device will establish a TCP connection to the given
 * service, and periodically send data to that service. The first data
 * packet is usually transmitted after SYN/ACK, also ACKing the SYN/ACK.
 * The data packets can optionally include a (little endian) sequence
 * number (in the TCP payload!) that is generated by the device, and, also
 * optionally, a token from a list of tokens. This serves as a keep-alive
 * with the service, and for NATed connections, etc.
 *
 * During this keep-alive period, the server doesn't send any data to the
 * client. When receiving data, it is compared against the wakeup pattern
 * (and mask) and if it matches, the host is woken up. Similarly, if the
 * connection breaks or cannot be established to start with, the host is
 * also woken up.
 *
 * Developer's note: ARP offload is required for this, otherwise TCP
 * response packets might not go through correctly.

 * @FC80211_FEATURE_CELL_BASE_REG_HINTS: This driver has been tested
 *	to work properly to suppport receiving regulatory hints from
 *	cellular base stations.
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_SAE: This driver supports simultaneous authentication of
 *	equals (SAE) with user space SME (FC80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE) in station
 *	mode
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_LOW_PRIORITY_SCAN: This driver supports low priority scan
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_SCAN_FLUSH: Scan flush is supported
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_AP_SCAN: Support scanning using an AP vif
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_VIF_TXPOWER: The driver supports per-vif TX power setting
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_NEED_OBSS_SCAN: The driver expects userspace to perform
 *	OBSS scans and generate 20/40 BSS coex reports. This flag is used only
 *	for drivers implementing the CONNECT API, for AUTH/ASSOC it is implied.
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_P2P_GO_CTWIN: P2P GO implementation supports CT Window
 *	setting
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_P2P_GO_OPPPS: P2P GO implementation supports opportunistic
 *	powersave
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_FULL_AP_CLIENT_STATE: The driver supports full state
 *	transitions for AP clients. Without this flag (and if the driver
 *	doesn't have the AP SME in the device) the driver supports adding
 *	stations only when they're associated and adds them in associated
 *	state (to later be transitioned into authorized), with this flag
 *	they should be added before even sending the authentication reply
 *	and then transitioned into authenticated, associated and authorized
 *	states using station flags.
 *	Note that even for drivers that support this, the default is to add
 *	stations in authenticated/associated state, so to add unauthenticated
 *	stations the authenticated/associated bits have to be set in the mask.
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_ADVERTISE_CHAN_LIMITS: cfgd11 advertises channel limits
 *	(HT40, VHT 80/160 MHz) if this flag is set
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_USERSPACE_MPM: This driver supports a userspace Mesh
 *	Peering Management entity which may be implemented by registering for
 *	beacons or FC80211_CMD_NEW_PEER_CANDIDATE events. The mesh beacon is
 *	still generated by the driver.
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_ACTIVE_MONITOR: This driver supports an active monitor
 *	interface. An active monitor interface behaves like a normal monitor
 *	interface, but gets added to the driver. It ensures that incoming
 *	unicast packets directed at the configured interface address get ACKed.
 * @FC80211_FEATURE_AP_MODE_CHAN_WIDTH_CHANGE: This driver supports dynamic
 *	channel bandwidth change (e.g., HT 20 <-> 40 MHz channel) during the
 *	lifetime of a BSS.
